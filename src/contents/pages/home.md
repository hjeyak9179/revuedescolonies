Welcome to the project website for the Digital Scholarly Edition and Translation of the _Revue des Colonies_ (1834-1842), the first French periodical for and by people of color.

Ultimately, the site will host the first open-access edition and translation of the _Revue_'s entire print run, featuring digitized images, full text transcriptions, English translations and bilingual annotations emanating from the collaboration of an international and interdisciplinary team of scholars. This critical apparatus situates the journal's emancipatory rhetoric in the political, material, and cultural contexts of its publication, and belongs to a growing body of scholarship centering the contributions of Black writers to the political and cultural transformations of the nineteenth century.

Please check back regularly as more annotated and translated issues of the _Revue_ become available.
